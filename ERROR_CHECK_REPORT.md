## 📊 Analysis Summary

### **Critical Issues: 0** ❌
### **Warnings: 3** ⚠️
### **Info/Suggestions: 37** ℹ️

## ⚠️ Warnings (Non-Critical)

### 1. **Unused Legacy Files**
**Impact:** None (files not imported anywhere)

**Files:**
- `lib/screens/login_screen.dart` - Old email/password login (replaced)
- `lib/screens/video_list_screen.dart` - Old video list (replaced)
- `lib/services/auth_service.dart` - Old auth service (replaced)
- `lib/widgets/watermark_overlay.dart` - Removed feature
- `lib/widgets/security_overlay.dart` - Removed feature

**Action:** Can safely delete these files (optional cleanup)

### 2. **Unused Fields**
**Impact:** Minor - causes linter warnings only

**Files:**
- `lib/screens/video_list_screen.dart:21` - `_selectedCategory` field
- `lib/screens/video_player_screen.dart:31` - `_lastSavedPosition` field
- `lib/services/video_service.dart:8` - `_functions` field

**Action:** These are in legacy files, can ignore

### 3. **Deprecated dart:html Usage**
**Impact:** Low - Wasm incompatible but works fine with JavaScript

**Files:**
- `lib/screens/video_player_screen.dart` - Uses `dart:html` for iframe
- `lib/widgets/security_overlay.dart` - Legacy file

**Action:** Works perfectly for now, can migrate to `package:web` later

---

## ℹ️ Info/Suggestions (Safe to Ignore)

### **1. Print Statements (37 occurrences)**
All services use `print()` for error logging instead of proper logging framework.

**Action:** Works fine, can upgrade to `logger` package later for production

### **2. Linter Preferences**
- Prefer final fields for some private variables
- Prefer string interpolation in one place

**Action:** Optional code style improvements, not errors

## 🧪 Runtime Verification Checklist

### **Before First Run**

#### **1. Firebase Console Setup**
- [ ] Enable Google Sign-In in Authentication
- [ ] Add authorized domain for web
- [ ] Create `settings/payment` document:
  ```
  {
    "qrCodeImageUrl": "https://...",
    "upiId": "yourname@paytm",
    "paymentNote": "Pay using any UPI app"
  }
  ```
- [ ] Create sample course in `courses` collection
- [ ] Update Firestore security rules

#### **2. Google OAuth Configuration**
- [ ] Web: Configure OAuth consent screen
- [ ] Web: Add OAuth client ID
- [ ] Add `localhost` to authorized domains for testing

## 🐛 Potential Runtime Issues (And Solutions)

### **Issue 1: Google Sign-In Fails**
**Symptom:** Sign-in dialog opens but doesn't complete
**Cause:** OAuth not configured
**Solution:**
1. Firebase Console → Authentication → Google → Enable
2. For web: Configure OAuth consent screen
3. Add authorized domain

### **Issue 2: No Courses Showing**
**Symptom:** Empty state on Courses tab
**Cause:** No courses in Firestore
**Solution:** Create course document (see SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

### **Issue 3: QR Code Not Loading**
**Symptom:** Gray placeholder instead of QR
**Cause:** Payment settings not configured
**Solution:** Create `settings/payment` document in Firestore

### **Issue 4: Videos Not Playing**
**Symptom:** Error when clicking video
**Cause:** Invalid bunnyVideoGuid
**Solution:** Use valid Bunny.net video GUID

### **Issue 5: Provider Error**
**Symptom:** "Provider not found" error
**Cause:** Screen used outside Provider scope
**Solution:** All screens are within MultiProvider scope, this shouldn't happen
